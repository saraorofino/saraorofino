### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sara and I'm a Project Scientist at the [Environmental Markets Lab](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/) at University of California, Santa Barbara. My research looks at how technology and big data can support sustainable fisheries by leveraging satellite-based vessel tracking (i.e. Automatic Identification Systems), Electronic Monitoring, and Synthetic Aperature Radar in research related to bycatch mitigation, fisheries transparency, and protected area design. I work collaboratively with partners at [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/) providing support to other emLab projects to assist with integrating new satellite data products into our research. Check out [emLab's GitHub](https://github.com/emlab-ucsb) for repositories related to our published research. 

Prior to emLab, I was an Ocean Health Index fellow at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), working with partners at the Nature Conservancy to complete an [Ocean Health Index (OHI) assessment](https://raw.githack.com/OHI-4site/pal-scores/master/documents/methods-results/Supplement.html) of Palmyra Atoll. I have a Masters in Environmental Science & Management from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara.
