Hi there! My name is Sara (she/her/hers) and I'm a Project Scientist at the [Environmental Markets Lab](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/) (emLab) at University of California, Santa Barbara. I'm interested in the role of data and technology in supporting decision-making, improving marine conservation, and enhancing sustainable and equitable fisheries. I love surfing, camping, reading, and used to work as a PADI Divemaster in Thailand and the Bahamas :ocean: :diving_mask:. 

### Research 

Currently:   
- ðŸ”­ Investigating how big data can support sustainable fisheries by leveraging satellite-based vessel tracking (i.e. Automatic Identification Systems), Electronic Monitoring, and Synthetic Aperature Radar in research related to bycatch mitigation, fisheries transparency, and protected area design   
  - Check out [emLab's GitHub](https://github.com/emlab-ucsb) for repositories related to our published research    

- :desktop_computer:  Developing and improving workflows that integrate R, SQL, BigQuery, and Google Cloud Computing 

- :world_map: Collaborating with [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/) to provide support to emLab projects and other partners seeking to use satellite data products in their research 

Previous:  
- :fish: Ocean Health Index fellow at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), working with partners at the Nature Conservancy to complete an [Ocean Health Index (OHI) assessment](https://raw.githack.com/OHI-4site/pal-scores/master/documents/methods-results/Supplement.html) of Palmyra Atoll   
- :tropical_fish: Oceanographic intern with the Coral Reef Advisory Group collecting and analyzing data to develop a management plan for coral reefs in the National Park of American Samoa
